Developer merge their code into a central repository as soon as possbile.After that developer changes are validated by creating build and then running automated tests against the build

## Continous Dilvery:

# What are the benefits of Cloud Computing
Users can scale services to fit their needs, customize applications and access cloud services from anywhere with an internet connection.Enterprise users can get applications to market quickly, without worrying about underlying infrastructure costs or maintenance.


# Difference b/w Git & Github
Git is version control system that lets you manage and track your source code  history while github is cloud-based hosting services that let you manage git repository 


# Stages of Git
1=> Working directory
2=> Stagging area
3=> local repository
4=> remote repository
